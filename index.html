      <ul>
        <li>With his wife Melinda, Bill Gates chairs the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the world's largest private
          charitable foundation.</li>
        <li>In May 2020, the Gates Foundation said it would spend $300 million to fight the coronavirus pandemic,
          funding treatment, detection and vaccines.</li>
        <li>Gates has sold or given away much of his stake in Microsoft -- he owns just over 1% of shares -- and
          invested in a mix of stocks and other assets.</li>
        <li>In mid-March 2020, Gates stepped down as a board member of Microsoft, the software firm he founded with Paul
          Allen (d. 2018) in 1975.</li>
        <li>The foundation works to improve global health and to create equal opportunity for people around the globe.
          To date, Gates has donated $35.8 billion worth of Microsoft stock to the Gates Foundation.</li>
      </ul>
