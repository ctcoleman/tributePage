## Project One: Tribute Page

### Objective

You can use HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to complete this project. Plain CSS is recommended because that is what the lessons have covered so far and you should get some practice with plain CSS. You can use Bootstrap or SASS if you choose. Additional technologies (just for example jQuery, React, Angular, or Vue) are not recommended for this project, and using them is at your own risk. Other projects will give you a chance to work with different technology stacks like React. We will accept and try to fix all issue reports that use the suggested technology stack for this project. Happy coding!

### Goals

[x] User Story #1: My tribute page should have an element with a corresponding id="main", which contains all other elements.

[x] User Story #2: I should see an element with a corresponding id="title", which contains a string (i.e. text) that describes the subject of the tribute page (e.g. "Dr. Norman Borlaug").

[x] User Story #3: I should see a div element with a corresponding id="img-div".

[x] User Story #4: Within the img-div element, I should see an img element with a corresponding id="image".

[x] User Story #5: Within the img-div element, I should see an element with a corresponding id="img-caption" that contains textual content describing the image shown in img-div.

[x] User Story #6: I should see an element with a corresponding id="tribute-info", which contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page.

[x] User Story #7: I should see an a element with a corresponding id="tribute-link", which links to an outside site that contains additional information about the subject of the tribute page. HINT: You must give your element an attribute of target and set it to _blank in order for your link to open in a new tab (i.e. target="_blank").

[x] User Story #8: The img element should responsively resize, relative to the width of its parent element, without exceeding its original size.

[x] User Story #9: The img element should be centered within its parent element.

### Additions

v2.0Sept 5th 2020: I'm calling this v2.0 because I esentially redid the whole layout. V1.0 adhered to the FreeCodeCamp challange listed above. This one gets 8/10 because I added the Microsoft Logo which eliminates the centered image challange. This looks nice though so I'm wiling to let it slide since the original did it just fine. I'm not sure what I was thinking with the css on this thing. Made it more visually pleasing. It's responsive without the excessive use of flexbox for no reason. I suppose it would work here but it's more trouble than it's worth for something so simple. I redid the box shadow and made flat cards out of the facts. I also redid the header resizing some text and resizing the header size. I also made the footer text smaller and the link looks a bit more...professional. I might add a table with awards given next....not sure...v3.0?? Lol
